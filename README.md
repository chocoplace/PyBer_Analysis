# **PyBer_Analysis**

## Overview of the PyBer analysis: 

The project aimed to perform exploratory analysis and deliver a series of visualization materials to help improve PyBer (transportation) services in underserved neighborhoods. The results will serve as a baseline to allocate resources strategically for future campaigns. For the outcomes of this project we prepared the following deliverables you can find here [Pyber_First_Analysis](https://github.com/chocoplace/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer.ipynb): 
- Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Merge your DataFrames.
- Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
- Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
  - The total number of rides for each city type.
  - The average fares for each city type.
  - The total number of drivers for each city type.
- Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
  - The number of rides for each city type.
  - The fares for each city type.
  - The number of drivers for each city type.
- Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
  - The percent of total fares.
  - The percent of total rides.
  - The percent of total drivers.
